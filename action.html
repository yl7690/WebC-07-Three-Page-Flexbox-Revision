            Wildlife conservation is the preservation and protection of animals, plants, and their habitats. By conserving wildlife, we're ensuring that future generations can enjoy our natural world and the incredible species that live within it. There are countless ways to help protect wildlife. There is never a way too useless to go with, and there is never anything worthless to do.

              <ul>
                <li>Reduce, reuse, recycle.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing consumer products uses energy and natural resources, and creates waste and pollution. When we consume less, we need fewer natural resources and produce less waste. Some waste, like plastic bags and bottles, can make its way into wildlands and oceans, with negative consequences for endangered species and other animals.</li>
                    <li>Do not throw it away if it still has a use! If you have unwanted books, toys, clothes or other items in good condition, consider giving them to charity instead of throwing them in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Avoid disposable products and products with excessive packaging or packaging that cannot easily be recycled. </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Restore. Habitat destruction is the main threat to 85 percent of all threatened and endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. You can help reduce this threat by planting native trees, restoring wetlands or cleaning up beaches in your area.</li>
                <li>Respect. Respect wild animals by keeping a safe distance away, not approaching them, and not removing them from their environment.</li>
              </ul>

Defenders of Wildlife lets you “symbolically” adopt a wild animal of your choosing. Your donation goes to improving habitats, research, monitoring, and ultimately saving the species from endangerment.</li>
                <li>Adopt a pet from a local animal shelter or rescue. There are so many animals without homes—and so many ways to save them.</li>
