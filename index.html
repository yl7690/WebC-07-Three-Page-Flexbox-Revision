              The human population has grown exponentially over the past 200 years, to more than seven billion people today, and it continues to rapidly grow. We have explored and left our footprint on nearly every corner of the globe. As our population and needs grow, we are leaving less and less room for wildlife. Most ecosystems are facing multiple threats, including habitat destruction, the introduction of invasive species from other parts of the world, climate change, pollution, hunting, fishing, poaching, etc. Each new threat puts additional stress on already weakened ecosystems and their wildlife.
